                DOM stands for Document Object Module. Browser recesive first Html code file form our local, server through url path or directory.
                First browser read all the html, css, js codes in the form of bytes then it Browser started to convert it into charecter and token.
                Secondly Browser converts them into node and each node are placed into tree structure like formation which we called DOM.
                This stage is also known as parseing stage.
                Then at last Html content are Display into charecter in the webpage.
                <br />
                <br />
                That's why we can get all the property and method related to the html elemet in the browser window.document or
                We can get all the event/event handler related to DOM in the window.document

                *removeEventListener()
                <br />
                *dispatchListener()  //have to read about it which is present in the browser window....
                <br />
                <br />


                <h2>EVENT LISTENER</h2>
                *event ("click", "blur", "keydown" etc.) <br />
                *event object (e)  //it is an object provied by browser js for manupulateing that DOM. <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                syntax in (Browser console):
