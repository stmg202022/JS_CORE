JS

#History:
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. 
It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. 
After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. 
Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5.

Netscape => Mozilla firebox(spider-monkey) => Chrome (V8 engine)

##How Js works on Chrome browser ?
Before it. See about DOM and CSSOM (browser maths).
Js execution will be holded until the CSSOM is ready. (JS-CSSOM)

#V8
It is the combination of both compiler and interpreter to convert into bytecode. 

Js code can be get from the network server, catch, etc by using URL.
There is a V8 engine in the chrome browser which helps to interprete and compiled Js code by using profiler into machine code for executions.

#(JIT) Just In Time (it helps to make js performace fast)
{ network, cache, server worker} => Js file => parse => AST (Abstract syntax Tree) => interprete + profiler
interpreter => bytecode
profiler => compiler => machine code => bytecode 
parse => it means to check js code line by line for grammatical. if the js code is correctly written then it goes to create AST
